# Pattern Recognition Weekly Coding Exercises  
## About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions to the weekly exercises of the 9th semester university subject "Pattern Recognition". Both reports and full problems statements are in Greek.

## Week 1 - Random Variables and Optimization
In this exercise 
- We calculate the probability mass function (PMF) of rolling a single die and then calculate the  
mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis of the  random variable
- Create a simulation of throwing in dice and calculating experimentally all the above values using python
- Do the same for 2 dice
- Implement **Gradient descent**  for known function 
- Implement **Newton Method** for  known function

## Week 2 - Probability theory and Bayesian Decision Theory
In this weekly assignment  we solve problems based on Bayesian Decision Theory. 
## Week 3 - Probabilistic Classifiers
In this exercise I create functions to
- Calculate decision boundary function for a known d dimension gaussian distribution with a known a priori   
probability 
- Calculate Euclidian distance for d dimensions
- Calculate Mahalanobis distance  
 
After that we use the above functions to solve problems using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**

## Week 4 - Non Parametric Estimation , Parzen Windows, K-NN
In this Exercise we create functions for **Kernel Density Estimation** Using **Parzen Windows** and **KNN**. These methods are then used to estimate the probability density function of a random variable

## Week 5 - Linear Classifiers
In this exercise we implement the following algorithms:
- Batch perceptron
- Batch relaxation with margin
- MSE using Pseudoinverse
- Windrow-Hopf (LMS)
- Ho Kashyap
- Kesler Construction

And use them to classify the IRIS flower Dataset
## Week 6 - Support Vector Machines
In this exercise we try different SVM for the IRIS flower Dataset using scikit-learn

## Week 7 - Multi-Layered Perceptrons
Using  scikit-learn we implement different MLP architectures for the IRIS Flower Dataset
